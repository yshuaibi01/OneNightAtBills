# OneNightAtBills
One Night At Bills'
-------------------

This is a game I made based on Five Nights at Freddys. It is a fanmade game but instead in Gravity Falls. It's a very short
game but its kinda difficult. 

Please read these before you play:

- To fullscreen first click the outer whiter circle, not inside; to unfullscreen click the grey dot

- To use the monitor you can kind of like flick your mouse down on it, and to get out of it flick your mouse back up, otherwise
the monitor will keep opening up

- To switch cameras click on the camera buttons

- There's only night, after you win or lose just click to return to the main menu where you can then exit

- Hit ESC button at any time to close the game completely

Other things:

I know some stuff is kinda poorly made like the jumpscare or whatever but I'm not good at animating so I had to 
just do the best I could.

Future Plans:
This game was kind of just a test to see if I can make a fanmade fnaf game and if it was decent maybe make a full-fledged one.
However, I don't think I will make a more fledged out one, this one was just a fun little side project and I no longer have interest
in making a game like it. It also took a long time to make and a lot of stuff will be hard to get like the art and assets since 
I can't draw and would have to get them else where. I think I'd be more interested in developing other original games instead.

Future Updates:
I may possibly update this game with small features or fix bugs if there are any.

This game was developed in ClickteamFusion 2.5 (so there wasn't much coding)
